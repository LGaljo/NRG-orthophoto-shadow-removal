## 2.4 Removing shadows from ortho-photo images
The goal of this seminar is to implement an algorithm that will take an aerial orthophoto as an input and output an
image with removed shading/shadows. To achieve this, you may apply one of the algorithms presented in [1, 2] or
some other state-of-the-art shadow removal algorithm. The developed algorithm should be able to read images in
different formats (at least JPG and PNG) and output the image in the same format. The application should support
piping so it can be used in an image processing pipeline.
